# Favicon Export for Adobe XD

_Export icons for your website._

## About this plugin

Favicon Export will help you generate many of the icons you need for websites. This plugin exports icons to a folder you choose, then copies HTML tags to your clipboard. A number of icons sizes are supported for web, iOS, and Android.

How to use in 2 steps:

1. Select a square artboard that contains your icon
1. Click "Export Favicons"

Optional steps:

1. If your icon has a transparent background, you'll get an option to choose a background color for the iOS icons.
1. Your options for iOS icon background colors come from the colors you set in XD's Assets panel. If you want more options for background colors, simply add more colors to the Assets panel.

Note: Currently exports PNGs only.
