### Description

Favicon Export will help you generate many of the icons you need for websites. This plugin exports icons to a folder you choose, then copies HTML tags to your clipboard.

A number of icons sizes are supported for web, iOS, and Android. Note that for icons with transparent backgrounds, the iOS icons will be exported with a white background in order to avoid the iOS default, which is black.
